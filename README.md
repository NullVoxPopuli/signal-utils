**Starting dev**

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

This will start a [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) command that runs the vite build and vitest tests in parallel.

Vitest isn't being used _within_ the package, because we want to exercise the public API, generated types, etc (through package.json#exports and all that).
